# English README - Button and Button List Usage

This mod designed for the use of buttons and button lists in a Discord bot. Here's an overview of the code and its purpose:

## Description
This code represents a Discord bot that utilizes buttons and button lists to provide interactive features for users. It's built using the Discord.js library and is intended to be used in a Discord server to facilitate tasks related to downloading and updating "Mods for Baldur's Gate 3."

## Features

1. **Download and Update Channels**: The bot creates two channels, "ðŸ“¥ download mods baldurs g3" and "ðŸ“¥ atualizar mods baldurs g3," in Discord servers. These channels are used for providing download links and displaying the latest updates for "Mods Baldur's Gate 3."

2. **Buttons for Actions**: Each channel has an associated button that users can interact with. In the "Download" channel, there's a "BAIXAR" (Download) button, and in the "Update" channel, there's an "ATUALIZAR" (Update) button.

3. **Select Menus**: When users click the "ATUALIZAR" button, they are presented with a select menu to choose from a list of updates. Similarly, when users click the "BAIXAR" button, they can select a version from a list.

## Usage

1. When the bot is online, it will create the necessary channels if they don't already exist in the server.

2. Users can click the "BAIXAR" button in the "Download" channel to initiate a download action.

3. Clicking the "ATUALIZAR" button in the "Update" channel will open a select menu where users can choose which update to view.

4. Users can select a version to download or an update to view from the provided lists.

## Important Note
This bot uses the Discord.js library and requires proper configuration and permissions to run successfully in your Discord server. Ensure you have the necessary permissions and have set up the bot with a valid token.

## Contributions and Customization
Feel free to customize the code to fit your specific needs or expand upon its functionality. You can add more options to the select menus or modify the bot's behavior as desired.
